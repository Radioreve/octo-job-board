# JobBoard OCTO

## Getting started

```bash
# get project sources
git clone git@github.com:octo-web-front-end-tribe/octo-job-board.git
cd octo-job-board

# install dependencies
npm install

# run tests
npm test

# build Vue.js  client for production with minification
npm run build

# start the application
npm start
```

You can run the API server independently from the client's development one.

## Server

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

## Client

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

## Release to production

The release to production process is as simple as running the command (from any branch):

```bash
npm run release
```
